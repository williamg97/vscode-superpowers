# Writing Plans

## Overview

Write comprehensive implementation plans assuming the engineer has zero context for the codebase and questionable taste. Document everything they need to know: which files to touch for each task, code, testing, docs they might need to check, how to test it. Give them the whole plan as bite-sized tasks. DRY. YAGNI. TDD. Frequent commits.

Assume they are a skilled developer, but know almost nothing about the toolset or problem domain. Assume they don't know good test design very well.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the writing-plans skill to create the implementation plan."

**Save plans to:** `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md`
- (User preferences for plan location override this default)

## Scope Check

If the spec covers multiple independent subsystems, it should have been broken into sub-project specs during brainstorming. If it wasn't, suggest breaking this into separate plans — one per subsystem. Each plan should produce working, testable software on its own.

## File Structure

Before defining tasks, map out which files will be created or modified and what each one is responsible for. This is where decomposition decisions get locked in.

- Design units with clear boundaries and well-defined interfaces. Each file should have one clear responsibility.
- Prefer smaller, focused files over large ones that do too much.
- Files that change together should live together. Split by responsibility, not by technical layer.
- In existing codebases, follow established patterns. If a file you're modifying has grown unwieldy, including a split in the plan is reasonable.

This structure informs the task decomposition. Each task should produce self-contained changes that make sense independently.

## Bite-Sized Task Granularity

**Each step is one action (2-5 minutes):**
- "Write the failing test" — step
- "Run it to make sure it fails" — step
- "Implement the minimal code to make the test pass" — step
- "Run the tests and make sure they pass" — step
- "Commit" — step

## Plan Document Header

**Every plan MUST start with this header:**

```markdown
# [Feature Name] Implementation Plan

> **For Copilot:** REQUIRED: Use `/subagent-driven-development` (if subagents available) or `/executing-plans` to implement this plan. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** [One sentence describing what this builds]

**Architecture:** [2-3 sentences about approach]

**Tech Stack:** [Key technologies/libraries]

```

## Task Structure

````markdown
### Task N: [Component Name]

**Files:**
- Create: `exact/path/to/file.ext`
- Modify: `exact/path/to/existing.ext:123-145`
- Test: `tests/exact/path/to/test.ext`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```typescript
test('specific behavior', () => {
  const result = fn(input);
  expect(result).toBe(expected);
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `npm test -- --testPathPattern=test.ext`
Expected: FAIL with "fn is not defined"

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

```typescript
export function fn(input: string): string {
  return expected;
}
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

Run: `npm test -- --testPathPattern=test.ext`
Expected: PASS

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add tests/path/test.ext src/path/file.ext
git commit -m "feat: add specific feature"
```
````

## Rules

- Exact file paths always
- Complete code in plan (not "add validation" — show the code)
- Exact commands with expected output
- DRY, YAGNI, TDD, frequent commits
- Each task should be completable independently

## Plan Review Loop

After completing each chunk of the plan:

1. Dispatch plan-document-reviewer subagent (see `plan-document-reviewer-prompt.md`) for the current chunk
   - Provide: chunk content, path to spec document
2. If Issues Found:
   - Fix the issues in the chunk
   - Re-dispatch reviewer for that chunk
   - Repeat until Approved
3. If Approved: proceed to next chunk (or execution handoff if last chunk)

**Chunk boundaries:** Use `## Chunk N: <name>` headings to delimit chunks. Each chunk should be ≤1000 lines and logically self-contained.

**Review loop guidance:**
- Same agent that wrote the plan fixes it (preserves context)
- If loop exceeds 5 iterations, surface to human for guidance

## Execution Handoff

After saving the plan:

**"Plan complete and saved to `docs/plans/<filename>.md`. Ready to execute?"**

**If subagents are available (Claude Code, etc.):**
- **REQUIRED:** Use `/subagent-driven-development`
- Fresh subagent per task + two-stage review

**If subagents are NOT available:**
- Execute plan in current session using `/executing-plans`
- Batch execution with checkpoints for review
