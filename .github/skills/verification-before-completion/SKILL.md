# Verification Before Completion

## Overview

Claiming work is complete without verification is dishonesty, not efficiency.

**Core principle:** Evidence before claims, always.

**Violating the letter of this rule is violating the spirit of this rule.**

## Why This Matters

Every time verification is skipped, it leads to one of:
- "Tests pass" → they don't → broken merge
- "Bug is fixed" → it isn't → user finds it again
- "Build succeeds" → it doesn't → deploy fails
- "Requirements met" → they aren't → rework

These aren't edge cases. They happen every time verification is skipped. The cost of running a command is seconds. The cost of a false claim is hours.

## The Iron Law

```
NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE
```

If you haven't run the verification command in this message, you cannot claim it passes.

## The Gate Function

Before claiming any status or expressing satisfaction:

1. **IDENTIFY** — What command proves this claim?
2. **RUN** — Execute the FULL command (fresh, complete)
3. **READ** — Full output, check exit code, count failures
4. **VERIFY** — Does output confirm the claim?
   - If NO: State actual status with evidence
   - If YES: State claim WITH evidence
5. **ONLY THEN** — Make the claim

Skip any step = lying, not verifying.

## Common Failures

| Claim | Requires | Not Sufficient |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Tests pass | Test command output: 0 failures | Previous run, "should pass" |
| Linter clean | Linter output: 0 errors | Partial check, extrapolation |
| Build succeeds | Build command: exit 0 | Linter passing, logs look good |
| Bug fixed | Test original symptom: passes | Code changed, assumed fixed |
| Regression test works | Red-green cycle verified | Test passes once |
| Agent completed | VCS diff shows changes | Agent reports "success" |
| Requirements met | Line-by-line checklist | Tests passing |

## Red Flags — STOP

- Using "should", "probably", "seems to"
- Expressing satisfaction before verification ("Great!", "Perfect!", "Done!")
- About to commit/push/PR without verification
- Trusting agent success reports
- Relying on partial verification
- Thinking "just this once"
- Tired and wanting work over
- **ANY wording implying success without having run verification**

## Rationalization Prevention

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Should work now" | RUN the verification |
| "I'm confident" | Confidence ≠ evidence |
| "Just this once" | No exceptions |
| "Linter passed" | Linter ≠ compiler |
| "Agent said success" | Verify independently |
| "I'm tired" | Exhaustion ≠ excuse |
| "Partial check is enough" | Partial proves nothing |
| "Different words so rule doesn't apply" | Spirit over letter |

## Key Patterns

**Tests:**
```
GOOD: [Run test command] [See: 34/34 pass] "All tests pass"
BAD:  "Should pass now" / "Looks correct"
```

**Regression tests (TDD Red-Green):**
```
GOOD: Write → Run (pass) → Revert fix → Run (MUST FAIL) → Restore → Run (pass)
BAD:  "I've written a regression test" (without red-green verification)
```

**Build:**
```
GOOD: [Run build] [See: exit 0] "Build passes"
BAD:  "Linter passed" (linter doesn't check compilation)
```

**Requirements:**
```
GOOD: Re-read plan → Create checklist → Verify each → Report gaps or completion
BAD:  "Tests pass, phase complete"
```

**Agent delegation:**
```
GOOD: Agent reports success → Check VCS diff → Verify changes → Report actual state
BAD:  Trust agent report
```

**Multi-step verification:**
```
GOOD: Lint ✓ → Build ✓ → Test ✓ → "All checks pass"
BAD:  "Lint passes" → assume build and tests also pass
```

## When To Apply

**ALWAYS before:**
- ANY variation of success/completion claims
- ANY expression of satisfaction
- ANY positive statement about work state
- Committing, PR creation, task completion
- Moving to next task
- Reporting status to user

**Rule applies to:**
- Exact phrases
- Paraphrases and synonyms
- Implications of success
- ANY communication suggesting completion/correctness

**No exceptions for:**
- "Simple" changes (simple changes break things too)
- "Obvious" fixes (obvious ≠ verified)
- Time pressure (verification takes seconds)
- Fatigue (especially under fatigue)

## The Bottom Line

Run the command. Read the output. THEN claim the result.

This is non-negotiable.
